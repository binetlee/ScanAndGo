Scan and Go Proof of Concept

A proof of concept of Scan and Go that was completed in 3 days. The intention was to allow authenticated customers to scan their own items in store without associate assistance, and using pre-stored credit cards to pay, with the transaction being finalized when an associate scanned a generated QR code receipt. Written in React.JS. Address customer pain points on waiting in long checkout lines when they are in a hurry, while incentivizing customer authentication due to an expediated checkout process.

To Run:
Navigate to scan-and-go, ```npm install``` and ```npm run start``` to launch demonstration.

Key Features:

1. Integrated Barcode code scanning for adding items to cart via phone
2. Support for multiple impulse item buys at the checkout page
3. Live receipt production via QR code, for easy QR code 
4. POC to work for both native and browser clients
